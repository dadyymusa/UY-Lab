      Peter Parker was a regular high school student until a radioactive spider
      bite granted him incredible powers, including super strength, agility,
      wall-crawling, and a "spider-sense" that alerts him to danger. Initially,
      Peter used his powers selfishly, seeking fame and money, until tragedy
      struckâ€”he let a thief go free, only for that same criminal to later kill
      his beloved Uncle Ben. Haunted by guilt, Peter embraced Uncle Ben's last
      lesson: "With great power comes great responsibility." From that moment
      on, he devoted himself to fighting crime as Spider-Man, balancing his
      heroic duties with the everyday struggles of a young man trying to protect
      those he loves.
