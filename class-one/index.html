    <p>
      The classic story follows the titular Doraemon, a robotic cat sent into
      the past by the grandson of Nobita Nobi to prevent a life of poverty and
      failure that affects not only Nobita, but his entire family. As a
      ten-year-old, Nobita refuses to take responsibility for his poor grades
      and failures, so Doraemon tries to help him learn the error of his ways
      and grow into a respectable adult -- though not without shenanigans along
      the way.Doraemon will usually have some sort of futuristic tech that can
      help Nobita with whatever issue he has, but using said tech ends up
      exacerbating the problem rather than fixing it. The series is popular
      among children and has been referenced in numerous other popular anime
      franchises because of how well-known it has become over the decades.
